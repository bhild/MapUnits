This is a simple game created for my Advanced Java final. The goal is to mine out the map of resources. _!
There are 2 types: yellow and blue. You can build 1 yellow worker to start. Workers will "mine‚Äù a node then return home._!
 This increments your resource total. You can expend your collected resources to create new workers._!
  Blue resource is used to build defenders who will seek out attackers and destroy them, at the cost of the defender._!
   They have 2 AI types: 0, where they wander around the center clearing, and 1, where they stay put after creation.
